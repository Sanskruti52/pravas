      <p>Fort Sindhugarh fort was erected by Shivaji Maharaj in 1664-67 AD on 48 acres of the island. It is believed that he personally selected this location, which is a rocky island.  The solid walls and beautiful gateways of this fort make it look absolutely majestic.  The fort also makes a perfect place to take some great pictures with the Arabian Sea in the background.

      <h3>Preserving Local History</h3>
<p>Forts in a way are monuments too and the thought in the minds of people that heritage sites must be preserved should be strengthened. The awareness to know the history of the State to move forward is growing among people. Although these forts did not hold strategic importance during the 20th century space age, these were the very forts which protected the State during the medieval era. </p>
